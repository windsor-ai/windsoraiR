# windsoR

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of `windsoR` is to help `R` users to access the `Windsor.ai` `API` in a convenient way from `R`

## Installation

~~You can install the released version of windsoraiR from~~ [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:


~~install.packages("windsoraiR")~~



And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("windsor-ai/windsoraiR")
```

## Usage

The package currently has only one function `windsor_fetch` which will return a `data.frame` provided that all of the arguments are supplied to it: your API key, the connector, date range, and fields you require.
