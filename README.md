# windsoraiR

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of `windsoraiR` is to help `R` users to access the `Windsor.ai`
`API` in a convenient way from `R`

[Windsor.ai](https://www.windsor.ai/) allows to get marketing data from
any platform. It beautifully simplifies the complexity of dealing with
multiple platforms, unlocking unified, valuable information in a format
that matters to you. For more details checkout
[onboard.windsor.ai](https://onboard.windsor.ai/).

## Installation

~~You can install the released version of windsoraiR from~~
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

~~install.packages(“windsoraiR”)~~

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("windsor-ai/windsoraiR")
```

## Features

-   Easy access to marketing data via windsor.ai APIs

-   Lightweight (single dependency - jsonlite)

## Usage

### Registration

You need to get a free API key to access windsor.ai’s APIs. Register
your account first and add a datasource like facebook ads and then get
the API key. For more details check out our official API documentation
and this article. Get the API key at <https://onboard.windsor.ai>

### Minimal Example

The package currently has only one function `windsor_fetch` which will
return a `data.frame` provided that all of the arguments are supplied to
it:

-   your API key,
-   the connector,
-   date range,
-   and fields you require.

Running:

``` r
df <- windsor_fetch(api_key = "your api key",
 connector = "all",
 date_preset = "last_7d",
 fields = c("source", "campaign", "clicks",
            "medium", "sessions", "spend"))
            
```

Will return a `data.frame` from the connector `all` that blends all data
from the platforms you have connected.

``` r
glimpse(df)
Rows: 140
Columns: 6
$ data.campaign <chr> "Kampanja #1", "Myyntipäällikök…
$ data.clicks   <int> 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0…
$ data.spend    <dbl> 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0…
$ data.medium   <chr> "Unknown", "Unknown", "Unknown"…
$ data.source   <chr> "google", "google", "google", "…
$ googlesheets  <chr> "'spreadsheet_id'", "'spreadshe…
```
